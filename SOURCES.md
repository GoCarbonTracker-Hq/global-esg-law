# Sources

Licence-reviewed official sources, and for each `pass` source one download request proven on 2026-11-01. Requests were run with `curl`. Sizes are bytes as returned. Rows that are not `pass` (India Code, SEBI, FCA Handbook, UK SRS) have no recipe: their instruments are link only.

## EU

Row `EU-EURLEX-ADOPTED`. The URL written in the licence table answers only with the right headers.

Adopted form, CSRD (CELEX 32022L2464):

```
curl -sS -L -o csrd_adopted.xhtml -H 'Accept: application/xhtml+xml' -H 'Accept-Language: eng' -w '%{http_code} %{size_download} %{content_type}\n' https://publications.europa.eu/resource/celex/32022L2464
```

Returned `200 625257 application/xhtml+xml;charset=UTF-8`, the full act text. The same headers also returned 200 for the other EU acts in `register/EU/scope.json`. Metadata (including the entry-into-force date) comes with `-H 'Accept: application/xml;notice=object'`, which returned 200, 1084774 bytes, `application/xml;notice=object`. Not working: `Accept: application/xml` or `text/html` (404), a `.ENG.xhtml` suffix (a 3151-byte RDF stub), and the `eur-lex.europa.eu` HTML pages (202, empty, bot challenge).

Row `EU-EURLEX-CONSOLIDATED`. Consolidated form, CSRD as of 2026-03-18 (the consolidation id starts with 0, and the date comes from the notice):

```
curl -sS -L -o csrd_cons_20260318.xhtml -H 'Accept: application/xhtml+xml' -H 'Accept-Language: eng' -w '%{http_code} %{size_download} %{content_type}\n' https://publications.europa.eu/resource/celex/02022L2464-20260318
```

Returned `200 295274 application/xhtml+xml;charset=UTF-8`. Without the `Accept` header the same URL returns a 25889-byte RDF stub.

Stored by GEL-01-03 (fetched 2026-11-01 with the two recipes above, `Accept: application/xhtml+xml`, `Accept-Language: eng`; each record carries `fetched_url` and `fetched_sha256`):

- `eu-csrd-2022-2464`: adopted text, in force 2023-01-05; consolidated texts 2025-04-17 (header `02022L2464 — EN — 17.04.2025 — 001.001`) and 2026-03-18 (header `18.03.2026 — 002.001`). Both consolidated files keep the EUR-Lex banner saying they are a documentation tool with no legal effect; the authentic text is the Official Journal act.
- `eu-esrs-2023-2772`: adopted text, in force 2023-12-25; consolidated texts `02023R2772-20231222` (header `22.12.2023 — 000.002`, stored by GEL-03-11 as `in_force` 2023-12-25 because the act entered into force then and the id date is the OJ publication day; the text differs from the adopted record, so it is kept: it has the EUR-Lex banner, no preamble, and the corrigenda applied) and `02023R2772-20250101` (header `01.01.2025 — 001.001`; its amendment table lists M1, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2025/1416, published 10.11.2025, so this text includes an amendment that entered into force 2025-11-13 and the id date 2025-01-01 is the date from which the amended text applies, not the date it took effect; stored with `in_force` 2025-01-01 as the Cellar id gives it). Both fetched 2026-11-02 with the recipe above, 200. Both keep the documentation-tool banner (no legal effect). Earlier guesses `02023R2772-20251113`, 20231225, 20231226, 20240101, 20251114, 20251231 and 20260101 returned 404 with the same headers; those 404s are not evidence that no consolidation exists. The Cellar watcher `eu-esrs-cellar-consolidations` lists exactly the two ids above; a later consolidation date is possible.
- `02022L2464-20230105` (CSRD consolidated at its own entry into force) returned 404.
- Not stored here: Taxonomy, SFDR, CSDDD, the two Omnibus directives and the two ESRS amendment acts (GEL-01-10, 11, 13); their scope entries are unchanged.

### GEL-01-11

Stored (fetched 2026-11-01 with the two EU recipes above, `Accept: application/xhtml+xml`, `Accept-Language: eng`):

- `eu-csddd-2024-1760`: adopted text (`32024L1760`), in force 2024-07-25; consolidated texts 2025-04-17 (`02024L1760-20250417`, header `17.04.2025 — 001.002`) and 2026-03-18 (`02024L1760-20260318`, header `18.03.2026 — 002.001`). Both consolidated files keep the EUR-Lex documentation-tool banner (no legal effect).
- `02024L1760-20240725` and `02024L1760-20260319` returned 404. The list of published consolidated dates could not be opened (bot challenge), so a consolidation at another date is possible.
- The two Omnibus acts are stored by GEL-01-13; their scope entries are unchanged.


### GEL-01-10 (EU Taxonomy and SFDR, fetched 2026-11-01)

Fetched with the two EU recipes above (`Accept: application/xhtml+xml`, `Accept-Language: eng`). Consolidated dates were listed with a SPARQL query against `https://publications.europa.eu/webapi/rdf/sparql` (work ids `0<celex>-<date>`), then each id was fetched and its header (`<celex> — EN — <date>`) checked against the id. In-force dates of the adopted acts are the OJ publication date plus 20 days (final article), matching the Cellar notice.

| Instrument | Adopted (in force) | Consolidated (date in id) |
|---|---|---|
| Taxonomy Regulation 2020/852 | 2020-07-12 | none found |
| SFDR 2019/2088 | 2019-12-29 | 2020-07-12, 2024-01-09, 2026-07-02 |
| Climate DA 2021/2139 | 2021-12-29 | 2023-01-01, 2024-01-01, 2025-01-01, 2025-01-08, 2026-01-01 |
| Disclosures DA 2021/2178 | 2021-12-30 | 2023-01-01, 2024-01-01, 2026-01-01 |
| Complementary Climate DA 2022/1214 | 2022-08-04 | none found |
| Environmental DA 2023/2486 | 2023-12-11 | 2026-01-01 |
| Amendment DA 2023/2485 | 2023-12-11 | none found |
| Simplification DA 2026/73 | 2026-01-28 | none found |
| SFDR RTS 2022/1288 | 2022-08-14 | 2023-02-20 |

Not found (HTTP 404 with the recipe headers, though the SPARQL list shows the id): `02020R0852-20200622`, `02021R2178-20211210`, `02023R2486-20231121`. `02020R0852-20200712`, `-20220101`, `-20230101`, `02021R2178-20211230`, `-20220101` and `02023R2486-20231211` also returned 404. The consolidated `02022R1288-20220725` (header `25.07.2022 — 000.002`) was fetched and then not stored: it is dated the OJ publication day, before the act entered into force on 2022-08-14, so it is not a version that took effect, and it duplicates the adopted text. Delegated Regulation (EU) 2024/3215 (corrects certain language versions of 2021/2139) and 2023/363 (amends 2022/1288) have no records of their own; 2023/363 shows in the consolidated 2022/1288 of 2023-02-20.

## India

All five instruments are link only, no records. Rows `IN-INDIACODE-ADOPTED` and `IN-SEBI-ADOPTED` are `permission requested` (no licence grant), so no recipe is proven. Permission requests were drafted on 2026-11-01 and not sent. Official pages were opened on 2026-11-01 only to verify dates.

| Instrument | Official URL | Why link only |
|---|---|---|
| Companies Act 2013 s.135 | https://www.indiacode.nic.in/show-data?actid=AC_CEN_22_29_00008_201318_1517807327856&orderno=139 | India Code row, permission requested. Page timed out and mca.gov.in answered 403 on 2026-11-01, so `in_force` stays null. |
| SEBI LODR reg 34(2)(f) | https://www.sebi.gov.in/sebi_data/attachdocs/jun-2026/1780915347745.pdf | SEBI row, permission requested. |

## UK

Row `UK-LEGISLATION-ADOPTED`, Companies Act 2006 as enacted:

```
curl -sS -L -o enacted.xml -w '%{http_code} %{size_download} %{content_type}\n' https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/enacted/data.xml
```

Returned `200 5239443 application/xml;charset=utf-8`. Secondary legislation as made, SI 2022/31, `https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2022/31/made/data.xml`: `200 35405 application/xml;charset=utf-8`.

Row `UK-LEGISLATION-CONSOLIDATED`, Companies Act 2006 as revised:

```
curl -sS -L -o revised.xml -w '%{http_code} %{size_download} %{content_type}\n' https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/data.xml
```

Returned `200 15193495 application/xml;charset=utf-8`. A single section works too: `.../ukpga/2006/46/section/414CB/data.xml` returned `200 86613 application/xml;charset=utf-8`.

### Stored (GEL-01-05, fetched 2026-11-01)

Records are under `records/GB/`. `text` is the plain text of the fetched `data.xml`: tags stripped, block elements as line breaks, the file's own commentary included, explanatory note and metadata left out. Each record carries the exact request URL and the sha256 of the file as returned.

| Instrument | Row | Versions stored (`in_force`) |
|---|---|---|
| `gb-ca2006-s414cb` | `UK-LEGISLATION-CONSOLIDATED` | 2016-12-26, 2022-04-06 |
| `gb-ca2006-s414a-414d` (Part 15 Chapter 4A) | `UK-LEGISLATION-CONSOLIDATED` | 2013-10-01, 2015-04-06, 2016-12-26, 2018-01-01, 2019-01-01, 2020-12-31, 2022-04-06 |
| `gb-uksi-2022-31` | `UK-LEGISLATION-ADOPTED` | 2022-04-06 (as made) |

Version dates are the `dct:hasVersion` links in the file's own metadata (section: 2016-12-26, 2022-04-06; chapter: the seven above). The point-in-time URL for a version's own date does not return that version: `.../section/414CB/2016-12-26/data.xml` and `.../chapter/4A/2013-10-01/data.xml` return 404, and `.../section/414CB/2022-04-06/data.xml` returns the pre-amendment text. So each record is fetched with a date inside the version's window (section 2017-06-01 and 2022-06-01; chapter 2014-06-01, 2016-06-01, 2017-06-01, 2018-06-01, 2019-06-01, 2021-06-01, 2022-06-01) and `fetched_url` says which. The 2016 section text was checked against the inserted text in SI 2016/1245 (made).

Chapter 4A `in_force` 2013-10-01 comes from SI 2013/1970 reg 1(2), opened on the day.

### Link only

`gb-fca-esg-sdr` (row `UK-FCA-HANDBOOK`, `permission requested`: Handbook terms unread) and `gb-uk-srs-s1-s2` (row `UK-SRS-ADOPTED`, `permission requested`: IFRS Foundation copyright). The gov.uk UK SRS page (opened 2026-11-01, last updated 25 February 2026) states no effective date, so its `in_force` stays null.

## US

Row `US-ECFR-ADOPTED`, 40 CFR Part 98. The 406 seen earlier is not about `Accept`: the body says "This endpoint requires response compression". Sending `Accept-Encoding` fixes it, which `--compressed` does:

```
curl -sS -L --compressed -o part98.xml -w '%{http_code} %{size_download} %{content_type}\n' 'https://www.ecfr.gov/api/versioner/v1/full/2026-10-01/title-40.xml?part=98'
```

Returned `200 521308 application/xml; charset=utf-8`. Without `--compressed`: 406, 171 bytes, text/plain.

Row `US-FEDREG-ADOPTED`, SEC climate rule (document 2024-05137):

```
curl -sS -L -o 2024-05137.json -w '%{http_code} %{size_download} %{content_type}\n' https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents/2024-05137.json
```

Returned `200 16622 application/json; charset=utf-8`. The JSON links the full text: `full_text_xml_url` returned `200 3377323 text/xml`. The 2009 EPA rule has document number `E9-23315`; `2009-23315` gives 404.

Stored by GEL-01-06 (2026-11-01):

- `us-epa-ghgrp-40cfr98` (row `US-ECFR-ADOPTED`, kind `consolidated`): all 28 version dates the versioner lists for part 98 (`/versions/title-40.json?part=98`, field `date`; 1131 rows, `meta.total_pages` 2, so the page-2 date 2019-09-19 needs `&page=2`; GEL-01-06 read page 1 only and stored 27, GEL-03-11 added 2019-09-19), 2017-01-01 to 2026-10-14, one record each, fetched with the recipe above at each date. The 2009 original is not on the versioner, so the scope entry keeps `in_force` 2009-12-29 and the earliest stored version is 2017-01-01. Text comes from the returned XML with tags stripped and block elements as line breaks; table cells are tab-separated.
- `us-sec-climate-disclosure-33-11275` (row `US-FEDREG-ADOPTED`, kind `adopted`, `in_force` 2024-05-28): text from `full_text_xml_url` of the JSON above. Legal status (stayed) is in the record `message` and the scope `status_note`, read from Federal Register documents 2024-07648 and 2026-11091 because sec.gov returns 403 to scripts and the Eighth Circuit docket was not opened.
- `us-ca-sb253`, `us-ca-sb261`: not touched here (GEL-01-12).

Row `US-CA-LEGINFO-ADOPTED`. The bill pages on `leginfo.legislature.ca.gov` return 403 to curl, so use the bulk downloads. SB 253 and SB 261 (2023-24 session) are in `pubinfo_2023.zip`; the 2025-26 session is `pubinfo_2025.zip`:

```
curl -sSI -L https://downloads.leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/pubinfo_2025.zip
```

Returned `200`, content length 1292052065 (about 1.2 GB), `application/zip`, `accept-ranges: bytes`. A range request `-r 0-3` returned 206 with 4 bytes. The full zip was not downloaded.

### GEL-01-12 (California, fetched 2026-11-01)

Row `US-CA-LEGINFO-ADOPTED`, kind `consolidated`. Fetched with `curl -L -O https://downloads.leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/pubinfo_2023.zip` (1261848876 bytes, archive dated 2024-11-25) into `/tmp`, never the repo. Layout: tab-separated `.dat` tables with backtick-quoted text fields, plus one `.lob` file per long text, named in the row. `LAW_SECTION_TBL.dat` holds codified sections (columns: id, law code, section, year, chapter, section of act, effective date, ..., history, lob file); `BILL_TBL.dat` and `BILL_VERSION_TBL.dat` hold bills and their versions. The `.lob` files are CAML XML; `text` is the element text with `<p>` as line breaks and `EnSpace` spans as one space. `fetched_sha256` is the hash of the zip as downloaded.

- `us-ca-sb253` (H&S 38532, row `HSC38532.20233822`, lob 123565) and `us-ca-sb261` (H&S 38533, row `HSC38533.20233832`, lob 123566): one record each, `in_force` 2024-01-01.
- `us-ca-sb219` (Stats. 2024, ch. 766, not ch. 1038 as the story says): chaptered act text from `BILL_VERSION_TBL_20214.lob`, `in_force` 2025-01-01 (no urgency clause). It is act text, not a codified section.
- The 2023 zip's section text predates SB 219's amendments (archive dated 2024-11-25). `pubinfo_2025.zip` (1292052065 bytes, dated 2026-10-26) was still downloading and was checked in GEL-01-08 below.
- CARB pages opened 2026-11-01 for `status_note`: the program page, the SB 261 Enforcement Advisory (2025-12-01) and the SB 253 Enforcement Notice (2024-12-05). Their URLs are in `register/US/scope.json`.

### GEL-01-08 (California 2025 check, 2026-11-01)

Row `US-CA-LEGINFO-ADOPTED`, kind `consolidated`. `pubinfo_2025.zip` (1292052065 bytes, archive dated 2026-10-26, sha256 `ec562b927cd7714905450feca5a8f0d887db4f4f9250192663481c6d7149a431`) was read from `/private/tmp/gel1201`, not downloaded again; only `LAW_SECTION_TBL.dat` and two lob files were unzipped, into `/tmp`. Same CAML-to-text recipe as GEL-01-12.

- `us-ca-sb253`: `LAW_SECTION_TBL.dat` row `HSC38532.20256091`, lob 50995, history line: "Amended by Stats. 2025, Ch. 609, Sec. 1.   (AB 154)   Effective October 11, 2025." New record `2025-10-11-consolidated.json`.
- `us-ca-sb261`: row `HSC38533.20256092`, lob 50996, history line: "Amended by Stats. 2025, Ch. 609, Sec. 2.   (AB 154)   Effective October 11, 2025." New record `2025-10-11-consolidated.json`.
- **Open item for Varun:** the sections as amended by SB 219 (effective 2025-01-01) are in neither zip. `pubinfo_2023.zip` (dated 2024-11-25) predates the amendment and `pubinfo_2025.zip` holds only the current AB 154 text. Only the SB 219 act text is stored (`us-ca-sb219`). A lookup for 38532 or 38533 on any date from 2025-01-01 to 2025-10-10 therefore returns the 2024-01-01 text. Whether to reconstruct the 2025-01-01 section text from the act is Varun's call.

### GEL-01-13 (EU Omnibus amendments, fetched 2026-11-01)

Four adopted-form records, row `EU-EURLEX-ADOPTED`, fetched with the CSRD adopted recipe above (`Accept: application/xhtml+xml`, `Accept-Language: eng`; all four returned 200). `in_force` is the Cellar notice field `RESOURCE_LEGAL_DATE_ENTRY-INTO-FORCE`, fetched with `Accept: application/xml;notice=object`, and matches the article quoted in each scope entry.

| Instrument | CELEX | `in_force` |
|---|---|---|
| `eu-omnibus-stop-the-clock-2025-794` | 32025L0794 | 2025-04-17 |
| `eu-omnibus-content-2026-470` | 32026L0470 | 2026-03-18 |
| `eu-esrs-amendment-2025-1416` | 32025R1416 | 2025-11-13 |
| `eu-esrs-amendment-2026-1563` | 32026R1563 | 2026-11-10 |

2026/1563 is published (OJ L, 21.9.2026) but not in force on 2026-11-01; its record `message` says so. `text` is the plain text of the returned XHTML, tags stripped, block elements as blank-line-separated lines. No consolidated version is stored: these are amending acts, and consolidation applies to the acts they amend. `02023R2772-20251113` and `02023R2772-20261110` (ESRS) return 404.

Further amending acts: a SPARQL query on `https://publications.europa.eu/webapi/rdf/sparql` for acts dated 2026-09-01 or later that amend 2022/2464, 2023/2772, 2024/1760 or 2013/34 returned no rows. The same query without the date bound returned these four, so it works. No new scope entry was added.

## Australia

Fetched 2026-11-02 (GEL-03-01). Nothing was blocked from the cloud address: legislation.gov.au, api.prod.legislation.gov.au, asic.gov.au, aasb.gov.au and auasb.gov.au all answered 200.

Rows `AU-LEGISLATION-ADOPTED` and `AU-LEGISLATION-CONSOLIDATED` (Federal Register of Legislation, CC BY 4.0). The Register's web pages are a JavaScript app and hold no text in the HTML, so the text comes from its public OData API, `https://api.prod.legislation.gov.au/v1/`, as EPUB (a zip whose `OEBPS/document.opf` spine lists the XHTML files). Titles are addressed by Register id (`C...` Acts, `F...` legislative instruments); versions are listed by `/versions`. The EPUB is generated on request, so its bytes and sha256 differ between fetches; the extracted text does not (re-fetched and compared on the day).

As made, Climate Change Act 2022 (`C2022A00037`):

```
curl -sS -L -o cc_asmade.epub -w '%{http_code} %{size_download} %{content_type}\n' "https://api.prod.legislation.gov.au/v1/documents/find(titleId='C2022A00037',asAtSpecification='AsMade',type='Primary',format='Epub',uniqueTypeNumber=0,volumeNumber=0,rectificationVersionNumber=0)"
```

Returned `200 46469 application/epub+zip`.

Point-in-time compilation, same Act at 2023-04-12 (compilation 1; row `AU-LEGISLATION-CONSOLIDATED`):

```
curl -sS -L -o cc_20230412.epub -w '%{http_code} %{size_download} %{content_type}\n' "https://api.prod.legislation.gov.au/v1/documents/find(titleId='C2022A00037',asAt=2023-04-12T00:00:00Z,type='Primary',format='Epub',uniqueTypeNumber=0,volumeNumber=0,rectificationVersionNumber=0)"
```

Returned `200 34586 application/epub+zip`. The text starts "Act No. 37 of 2022 as amended / Compilation No. 1 / Compilation date: 12 April 2023", and the compilation number and date printed in each stored file match the `/versions` entry it was fetched for (checked for every compilation that prints them; the oldest NGER Act and Regulations compilations print only "prepared on <later date>").

Returned `200 2227 application/json; odata.metadata=minimal; odata.streaming=true; charset=utf-8`. Each version has `start`, `registerId`, `compilationNumber`; versions with `registerId` null (future-dated) have no published text and were skipped. Not working: `registerId='...'` in `find(...)` returned 404; `asAt` without a time or `asAtSpecification='<date>'` returned 400 (`Unhandled version expression combination`). `asAt` at a version's own start date returns that version (`asAt=2022-09-13` returns the as-made file, 46469 bytes). The same call with `format='Pdf'` returned `200 795288 application/pdf`; only the PDF is flagged `isAuthorised` in the `/documents` listing.

Text: all XHTML files in spine order, tags stripped, block elements as line breaks, cells tab-separated, non-breaking spaces left as returned. Compilations carry their own endnotes and amendment history; they are part of `text`.

In-force dates. A compilation record takes the `start` of its Register version. An as-made record takes the commencement date read from the Act or instrument itself, which can differ from the Register's first `start` (Royal Assent or registration date): Climate Change Act 2022-09-14 (Register 2022-09-13), Modern Slavery Act 2019-01-01 (Register 2018-12-10), NGER Act 2007-09-29 (Register 2007-09-28), NGER Regulations 2008-07-01 (Register 2008-06-26), Safeguard Mechanism Rule 2016-07-01 (Register 2015-10-08), Treasury Laws Amendment (FMIOM) Act 2024 Schedule 4 2024-09-18 (Register 2024-09-17), Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Act 2023 Schedules 1 to 3 2023-04-12 (Register 2023-04-11). Each sentence is in the scope entry's `evidence`.

Stored (record counts include the as-made record):

| Instrument | Row | Records | Consolidated dates stored |

`au-corporations-act-2001-pt2m3` is an extract. A full compilation of the Corporations Act 2001 is about 6.6 million characters of text (2.3 to 2.6 MB as EPUB), so each record keeps three blocks from the compilation unchanged: ss 292A, 296A to 296E, and Part 10.77 (application and transitional provisions for Schedule 4 of Act No. 87 of 2024). `fetched_sha256` is the hash of the whole EPUB. Compilations 135 to 149 (2024-09-18 to 2026-09-19) were all fetched. Compilation 135 (C2024C00372, 2024-09-18) is the first with s 292A. Its extract equals those of compilations 136 to 143 (2024-09-24, 2024-10-14, 2024-12-11, 2024-12-24, 2025-02-21, 2025-03-17, 2025-07-01, 2025-07-09), so those eight have no record. Compilation 144 (C2025C00696, 2025-12-05) changes the extract (adds ss 1707DA and 1707DB, after Act No. 72 of 2025, Schedule 4 Part 1, commencing 2025-12-05) and compilations 145 to 149 (2025-12-19, 2026-06-30, 2026-07-01, 2026-08-27, 2026-09-19) match it. A compilation that changes only other parts of the Act is therefore not a record. Future-dated Corporations Act versions (2026-12-01, 2026-12-04, 2027-04-08, 2027-07-01) have no published text.

Compilations of the NGER Act, Regulations and Rule with identical text to the previous version: none (every compilation changed the text).

Row `AU-ASIC-ADOPTED` (ASIC regulatory guides, for example RG 280 Sustainability reporting) is `permission requested`: ASIC's grant covers verbatim reproduction of regulatory guides under CC BY 4.0, and a tag-stripped extraction is not verbatim. Guides are not enacted law, so no scope entry uses the row; no recipe was proven. ASIC-made legislative instruments (class orders) are on the Federal Register and fall under the `AU-LEGISLATION` rows.

Not in scope: the Treasury Laws Amendment (Strengthening Financial Systems and Other Measures) Act 2025 (C2025A00072, Schedule 4 Part 1 Division 2 amends the Corporations Act sustainability provisions from 2025-12-05) is an omnibus of unrelated amendments and has no entry of its own; its effect is in the 2025-12-05 Corporations Act record. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (C2004A00485) is an F7 register row only.


## Switzerland

Rows `CH-FEDLEX-CONSOLIDATED` and `CH-FEDLEX-ADOPTED`, both `pass` on the statute basis (Copyright Act Art. 5; reuse conditions in Publication Ordinance Art. 49 are recorded in the row notes). The www.fedlex.admin.ch pages are a JavaScript application, so texts come from the Fedlex data API (`fedlex.data.admin.ch`), which answered from the cloud address on 2026-11-02. Language: German only. Run on 2026-11-02 for the Ordinance on Climate Disclosures (ELI `cc/2022/747`, SR 221.434).

Step 1, list the file URL of a consolidation (the file name ends in a version counter, so it cannot be guessed):

```
curl -sS -L -G -H 'Accept: text/csv' --data-urlencode 'query=PREFIX j: <http://data.legilux.public.lu/resource/ontology/jolux#> SELECT DISTINCT ?z WHERE { <https://fedlex.data.admin.ch/eli/cc/2022/747/20240101> j:isRealizedBy ?x . ?x j:language <http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/language/DEU> . ?x j:isEmbodiedBy ?y . ?y j:isExemplifiedBy ?z . FILTER(CONTAINS(STR(?z),"/xml/")) }' -o q.csv -w '%{http_code} %{size_download} %{content_type}\n' https://fedlex.data.admin.ch/sparqlendpoint
```

Returned `200 157 text/csv;charset=UTF-8`. The dates of all consolidations of a work come from `SELECT DISTINCT ?c ?d WHERE { ?c j:isMemberOf <WORK> . ?c a j:Consolidation . ?c j:dateApplicability ?d }` (always `DISTINCT`: the endpoint repeats rows otherwise). The as-adopted file comes from the work `eli/oc/...`, found with `<WORK> j:basicAct ?b`, then the same query on `?b`.

Step 2, row `CH-FEDLEX-CONSOLIDATED`, consolidated text as of 2024-01-01:

```
curl -sS -L -o vbk_20240101.xml -w '%{http_code} %{size_download} %{content_type}\n' https://fedlex.data.admin.ch/filestore/fedlex.data.admin.ch/eli/cc/2022/747/20240101/de/xml/fedlex-data-admin-ch-eli-cc-2022-747-20240101-de-xml-2.xml
```

Returned `200 10815 application/xml` (Akoma Ntoso).

Row `CH-FEDLEX-ADOPTED`, as adopted in the Official Compilation:

```
curl -sS -L -o vbk_adopted.xml -w '%{http_code} %{size_download} %{content_type}\n' https://fedlex.data.admin.ch/filestore/fedlex.data.admin.ch/eli/oc/2022/747/de/xml/fedlex-data-admin-ch-eli-oc-2022-747-de-xml.xml
```

Returned `200 10638 application/xml`. Without a `User-Agent` and with the default curl one both answered the same. The `Accept: application/sparql-results+json` header also works (`200 305 application/sparql-results+json`).

Text extraction: the `act` element without `meta`; block elements (preface lines, headings, articles, paragraphs, list items) as line breaks, article and paragraph numbers on the line of their text, footnotes (`authorialNote`) as their own `[Fussnote] ...` lines after the block that carries them. Nothing reworded. Each record's `fetched_sha256` is that of the whole file as returned. For the Code of Obligations (about 2 MB a version) the record text is one chapter (the Sixth Division for Art. 964a to 964c, the Eighth for Art. 964j to 964l), cut out of the fetched file by its heading.

Stored (fetched 2026-11-02): a consolidation is stored only when its text differs from the previous stored version, so the dates below are the dates the text changed. For an act with an as-adopted record, the first consolidation is stored only if its body (footnotes and the "Stand am" line ignored) differs.

| Instrument | Row | Versions stored (`in_force`) |
|---|---|---|
| `ch-co-art964a-c` | consolidated | 2022-01-01 (unchanged in the 11 consolidations from 2022-01-01 to 2027-07-01) |
| `ch-co-art964j-l` | consolidated | 2022-01-01 (same) |

| `ch-co2-ordinance` | consolidated | 14 versions, 2021-01-01 to 2026-01-01 |

Not served as XML or HTML (so not stored, no recipe): the as-adopted VSoTr (DOCX and PDF only), the as-adopted CO2 Act and CO2 Ordinance (DOC and PDF only), the CO2 Act consolidations of 2013-01-01, 2018-01-01 and 2020-01-01 (PDF only), CO2 Ordinance consolidations before 2021 and of 2020-01-01 and 2020-11-01 (PDF or DOC only), and the CO2 Ordinance consolidation of 2027-01-01 (no German file listed yet). Code of Obligations consolidations before 2022-01-01 are not stored because Art. 964a to 964c and 964j to 964l did not exist in this form before then.

## Brazil

Run on 2026-11-02 (GEL-03-07). Six rows pass: `BR-CAMARA-ADOPTED`, `BR-CAMARA-CONSOLIDATED` (terms: Câmara portal item 29, public domain with source citation), `BR-CVM-ADOPTED`, `BR-CVM-CONSOLIDATED`, `BR-BCB-ADOPTED`, `BR-BCB-CONSOLIDATED` (statute: Lei 9.610/1998 art. 8 IV). The CVM and BCB rows pass on the statute although gov.br general terms carry a Creative Commons no-derivatives notice (see the row notes); Varun to confirm. Text extraction: Câmara and CVM `.htm` files are tag-stripped HTML (headings and paragraphs as line breaks); CVM PDFs go through `pdftotext -layout` with runs of spaces collapsed and blank lines dropped, so their line breaks are the PDF's line wraps; BCB text is the `Texto` field of the JSON, tag-stripped.

Row `BR-CAMARA-ADOPTED`, Lei 15.042/2024 as published (the number after `publicacaooriginal-` is read from the `-norma-pl.html` page of the same law):

Row `BR-CAMARA-CONSOLIDATED`, same law, current text (`.../lei-15042-11-dezembro-2024-796690-normaatualizada-pl.html`): `200 162344 text/html; charset=UTF-8`. Decrees use `/legin/fed/decret/<year>/decreto-<n>-<date>-<id>-publicacaooriginal-<n>-pe.html`. The URL parts come from the `-norma-pl.html` / `-norma-pe.html` page, or from a LexML lookup (`https://www.lexml.gov.br/urn/urn:lex:br:federal:lei:2009-12-29;12187`, which lists the Câmara links for older laws).

The `anexos/NNN` band is read from the links on `https://conteudo.cvm.gov.br/legislacao/resolucoes/resol193.html`; guessed bands and the `.htm`/`.html` suffix often return 410 with a 16981-byte "page not found" body.

Row `BR-CVM-CONSOLIDATED`, Resolução CVM 193 consolidated: `curl -sS -L -o res193_consolid.pdf ... https://conteudo.cvm.gov.br/export/sites/cvm/legislacao/resolucoes/anexos/100/resol193consolid.pdf` returned `200 380912 application/pdf`. CVM serves one current consolidated file per resolution, so no earlier consolidation is stored.

```

Returned `200 50416 application/json; charset=utf-8`. The JSON holds `Titulo`, `DOU`, `Atualizacoes` (list of amendments, with "a partir de" dates when given) and `Texto` (HTML). `normativos.bcb.gov.br` attachment PDFs returned 404 or a connection reset for the guesses tried (`Attachments/<Id>/Res_4945_v1_O.pdf`, `_v2_P.pdf`, `_v2_L.pdf`), so the original wording of an amended BCB norm is not available; those instruments carry one dated record each (see scope notes).

Blocked from the cloud address: `https://www.planalto.gov.br/` (all paths tried, including `/ccivil_03/leis/l9610.htm` and `/ccivil_03/_ato2023-2026/2024/lei/L15042.htm`) answered with an empty reply or an 814-byte "Acesso Negado! Esta requisição foi bloqueada" page. Row `BR-PLANALTO-CONSOLIDATED` is `permission requested` for that reason; the orchestrator can open it from the laptop. Câmara copies were used instead. `https://www.in.gov.br` opened (home page 200) but no DOU act page was needed: publication dates come from the Câmara norma pages, the CVM pages and the BCB `DOU` field.

## Canada

Row `CA-JUSTICE-CONSOLIDATED` (Justice Laws Website, terms: Reproduction of Federal Law Order SI/97-5). Every dated version of an Act or regulation is one HTML page. The list of version dates is `PITIndex.html`; each link on it has the form `<date as YYYYMMDD>/P1TT3xt3.html`. Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act (C-19.3), run 2026-11-02, no special headers needed:

```

Returned `200 13717 text/html` and `200 61552 text/html`. Regulations use `regulations/SOR-2019-266` in place of `acts/C-19.3`; the largest page fetched was the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, 927352 bytes. The page for a date is the version that starts on that date (the version line in the page, "Version of document from X to Y", matched the date in every fetch). The current version of an instrument is also served as XML (`https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/XML/SOR-2019-266.xml` returned `200 633292 text/xml`), but only the HTML pages cover every dated version. One transient failure: the Competition Act page for 2024-06-20 returned an empty reply (curl exit 52) once and succeeded on retry.

Stored by GEL-03-02 (fetched 2026-11-02; each record has `fetched_url` and the sha256 of the page as returned, and the sha256 of `cneaa_20230331.html` above equals the record's). `text` is the content block of the page (`<div id="wb-cont" class="docContents">` up to `<!-- MAIN CONT DIV END -->`), tags stripped, block elements as line breaks, table cells tab-separated, the "Version of document" line left out. The page's own marginal notes, footnotes and amendment source lines are kept.

Notes on the dates. Justice Laws serves no separate as-enacted text: the first version of each instrument is the first consolidation. For the OBPS and the methane regulations that first version starts at registration, before the in-force date in the regulations (deemed 2019-01-01 and 2020-01-01), so the first record predates the in-force date in the scope entry; its `message` says so. The Competition Act has 26 versions; the four stored are the ones that contain s.74.01(1)(b.1) and (b.2) (in the 2023-12-15 version, which was fetched, s.74.01(1) has paragraphs (a) to (c) only). The Clean Fuel Regulations incorporate a standard by reference (s.2 names ISO 14064-3:2019); only the regulation's own text is stored.

The Gazette's own "About" page says the PDF is the official version and the HTML is unofficial.
- `ca-osfi-b15` (row `CA-OSFI-ADOPTED`, `permission requested`). `https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/en/guidance/guidance-library/climate-risk-management` returned `200 145939 text/html; charset=UTF-8`. The terms page (`/en/terms-conditions`) allows non-commercial reproduction and requires written permission for commercial redistribution.
- CSSB CSDS 1 and CSDS 2 (row `CA-CSSB-ADOPTED`, `permission requested`; no scope entry). Blocked from the cloud address: `https://www.frascanada.ca/` returned `403 5375 text/html; charset=UTF-8` with a Cloudflare challenge (`cf-mitigated: challenge`); `/en/sustainability`, `/en/sustainability/standards`, `/en/terms-of-use`, `/en/copyright` and `/en/legal` also returned 403, and an Internet Archive copy reset the connection. The orchestrator can read the terms from the laptop.
- Not reachable from the cloud address either: `https://www.canada.ca/en/transparency/terms.html` and the canada.ca GHG reporting program page (empty reply or HTTP/2 stream error).

## Hong Kong

GEL-03-05, run 2026-11-02. No Hong Kong row is `pass`, so no recipe is proven for storing text and `records/HK/` is empty. All five instruments are link only.

Not usable for a recipe, kept so the next run does not repeat it:

- `https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/` and every page under it (`/hk/cap622`, `/hk/copyright`) answer `302` to `/checkconfig/checkClientConfig.jsp?applicationId=RA001`, a JavaScript browser check that POSTs a CSRF-protected form. Replaying the form with a cookie jar, the CSRF token, Referer and Origin returned `400 Bad Request`. Terms on the site itself could therefore not be read from the cloud address; read them from the laptop browser.
- `https://en-rules.hkex.com.hk/` fails TLS verification from the cloud address (`curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate`). Blocked from the cloud address; certificate check not bypassed.

The open-data route to e-Legislation works. This request was run for the Caps. 601 onwards English file (it holds Cap. 622); it is the file read for dates, not stored text:

```
curl -sS -L -o hkel_c_leg_cap_601_cap_end_en.zip -w '%{http_code} %{size_download} %{content_type}\n' https://resource.data.one.gov.hk/doj/data/hkel_c_leg_cap_601_cap_end_en.zip
```

Returned `200 129334645 application/zip`. Caps. 301 to 600 (`hkel_c_leg_cap_301_cap_600_en.zip`, holds Cap. 311; Cap. 603 is in the 601 file) returned `200 560521008 application/zip`. Each zip holds one XML per cap (`cap_622_en_c\cap_622_20250523000000_en_c.xml`, version date in the name); the current-version dataset serves one version per cap. The dataset page is `https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-doj-hkel-legislation-current`. Past versions are a separate dataset (`hk-doj-hkel-legislation-past`), not fetched.

### Link only

| Instrument | Row | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `hk-cap622-sch5` | `HK-ELEGISLATION-CONSOLIDATED`, permission requested | DATA.GOV.HK terms v1.2 allow commercial reproduction with attribution and an indemnity but say nothing on modification; site's own copyright notice unreadable from the cloud address |
| `hk-hkex-esg-code-part-d` | `HK-HKEX-ADOPTED`, permission requested | HKEX Terms of Use bar copying, modifying and scripted access without written permission; rulebook host blocked from the cloud address |
| `hk-hkfrs-s1-s2` | `HK-HKICPA-ADOPTED`, permission requested | HKICPA terms: non-commercial use, no modification |
| `hk-hkma-spm-gs1` | `HK-HKMA-ADOPTED`, permission requested | HKMA terms: non-commercial, unmodified reproduction only |
| `hk-taxonomy-sustainable-finance` | `HK-HKMA-ADOPTED`, permission requested | same HKMA terms |

`HK-SFC-ADOPTED` is permission requested (prior written consent for third-party reproduction) and backs no scope entry. Air Pollution Control Ordinance (Cap. 311) and Product Eco-responsibility Ordinance (Cap. 603) are F7 and appear in `register/register.csv` only; their dates come from the commencement line in the bulk files above.
## Singapore

GEL-03-04, run 2026-11-02. No Singapore row is `pass`, so no fetch recipe is proven and no record is stored. All six scope entries are link only. The five rows (`SG-SSO-ADOPTED`, `SG-SSO-CONSOLIDATED`, `SG-SGX-CONSOLIDATED`, `SG-ACRA-ADOPTED`, `SG-MAS-ADOPTED`) are `permission requested`. No permission request was sent.

Blocked from the cloud address (read from the laptop):

- `https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Terms-of-Use` and `https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Acts-Supp/23-2018/Published/20181015?DocDate=20181015`: HTTP 403 "Request blocked" from CloudFront, to `curl -A 'Mozilla/5.0'` and to WebFetch. The Internet Archive copy reset the connection. The terms, the Acts and the in-force dates on SSO are unread.
- `https://www.mas.gov.sg/terms-of-use` and the MAS guideline pages: HTTP 200 with a maintenance page ("Sorry, this service is currently unavailable") to `curl -A 'Mozilla/5.0'`.
- `https://www.sgx.com/terms-use`: HTTP 200, 15329 bytes, a JavaScript browser-check shell with no terms text.

Opened and readable (plain `curl`, HTTP 200): `https://rulebook.sgx.com/rulebook/mainboard-rules` (2093399 bytes, text/html; holds rr 711A, 711B and Practice Note 7.6 with their amendment dates), `https://www.acra.gov.sg/terms-of-use/`, `https://www.acra.gov.sg/regulations/sustainability-reporting/requirements-timeline/`, `https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/climate-change-energy-efficiency/climate-change/carbon-tax`.

| Instrument | Why link only |
|---|---|
| `sg-sgx-lr-711a-711b`, `sg-sgx-pn-7-6` | `SG-SGX-CONSOLIDATED`: footer "© Singapore Exchange Limited. All Rights Reserved."; terms page unreadable. |
| `sg-cpa-2018`, `sg-cpa-mrv-regs-2018` | `SG-SSO-CONSOLIDATED`: SSO terms and pages blocked from the cloud address. |
| `sg-mas-erm-banks`, `-insurers`, `-asset-managers` | `SG-MAS-ADOPTED`: terms and pages show a maintenance page. |

ACRA (`SG-ACRA-ADOPTED`): terms say contents may not be reproduced "without the prior written permission of ACRA". The timeline page is guidance, and no enacted regulation for large non-listed companies was found, so ACRA has no scope entry. That page gives FY2030 for them, not FY2027. Not entered: the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy (no official page found or opened), the Energy Conservation Act 2012 and Resource Sustainability Act 2019 (F7, register rows only, URLs unopened).

## Japan

Fetched 2026-11-02 (GEL-03-03). Two rows are `pass`, `JP-EGOV-CONSOLIDATED` and `JP-FSA-ADOPTED`; `JP-SSBJ-ADOPTED` and `JP-JPX-ADOPTED` are `permission requested`. Nothing is stored from the FSA row.

Row `JP-EGOV-CONSOLIDATED`, e-Gov Law Search API v2. The law page `https://laws.e-gov.go.jp/law/<law_id>` is a script shell, so every request uses the API. List the point-in-time versions of a law (here the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures, law ID `410AC0000000117`):

```
curl -sS -L -o gw_revs.json -w '%{http_code} %{size_download} %{content_type}\n' https://laws.e-gov.go.jp/api/2/law_revisions/410AC0000000117
```

Returned `200 11234 application/json`. Each entry has `law_revision_id`, `amendment_enforcement_date`, `amendment_promulgate_date`, `current_revision_status` (`CurrentEnforced`, `PreviousEnforced`, `UnEnforced`) and `amendment_scheduled_enforcement_date` (set when the date is an outer limit or tied to another act, empty when fixed). Fetch one version as the law XML file:

```
curl -sS -L -o gw_20260101.xml -w '%{http_code} %{size_download} %{content_type}\n' https://laws.e-gov.go.jp/api/2/law_file/xml/410AC0000000117_20260101_506AC0000000056
```

Returned `200 360533 application/octet-stream` (the body is XML). Its sha256 `68590c43cbc18f327bc63cfb7d84b4b065463464f6ffd9903744d47a44534fca` equals `fetched_sha256` in `records/JP/jp-gw-act/2026-01-01-consolidated.json`. Law search by title: `https://laws.e-gov.go.jp/api/2/laws?law_title=<title>` returned 200, `application/json`. A revision id guessed wrong returns 404 with a JSON error body (120 bytes). The old v1 host `elaws.e-gov.go.jp/api/1/` also answers; it was not used.

Text recipe: `text` is the plain text of the returned XML. Block elements (articles, titles, captions, paragraphs, items, tables) start a new line; `Sentence`, `Column`, `Line`, `Ruby`, `Sup` and `Sub` stay inline; the reading inside `Rt` is dropped; table cells are tab-separated; each line is trimmed and empty lines are dropped. Nothing is reworded. Because the XML splits `ArticleTitle`, `ParagraphNum` and the sentence into separate elements, an article number sits on its own line above its text. Figures (`Fig`) are PDF attachments and carry no text, so form PDFs in the Cabinet Office Order are not in `text`.

Rules used for the version set:

- All versions e-Gov lists for the instrument are stored, oldest to newest. e-Gov starts in 2016 or later: no older text, and no as-promulgated (adopted) form, is served, so every record has `kind` `consolidated`.
- Several revisions can share one enforcement date (different amending acts). One record per date: the revision of the amending act promulgated last. Dates where this applied: FIEA 2016-04-01, 2025-04-01; Cabinet Office Order 2019-07-01, 2024-04-01, 2025-04-01; reporting order 2023-04-01.
- A revision not yet in force is stored when its date is fixed (`amendment_scheduled_enforcement_date` empty), with the status in `message`: FIEA 2026-11-30, 2027-04-01, 2027-10-01. Revisions with a scheduled (outer-limit or linked) date are not stored: FIEA 2027-03-31, 2027-07-22, 2028-01-01, 2028-06-13 (two revisions).

| `jp-gx-regulation` | 2 | 2024-02-16, 2026-04-01 |

`jp-fiea` is about 2.4 MB per record; the seven instruments add about 153 MB under `records/JP`.

Row `JP-FSA-ADOPTED`, FSA Roadmap on Sustainability Disclosure and Assurance:

```
curl -sS -L -o roadmap.pdf -w '%{http_code} %{size_download} %{content_type}\n' https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/news/2026/20260409/02.pdf
```

Returned `200 101942 application/pdf`. No record is stored: the roadmap is a policy paper, and plain-text extraction of a PDF has no stdlib path in this repository.

Terms pages, opened 2026-11-02: e-Gov `https://laws.e-gov.go.jp/terms/` (text read from the asset `/assets/terms-a5a45db6.js`, 200, 6343 bytes), PDL1.0 `https://www.digital.go.jp/resources/open_data/public_data_license_v1.0` (200), FSA `https://www.fsa.go.jp/rules/index.html` (200), SSBJ footer `https://www.ssb-j.jp/en/` (200), JPX `https://www.jpx.co.jp/english/term-of-use/index.html` (200).

### Link only

| Instrument | Why |
|---|---|
| `jp-ssbj-standards` | Row `JP-SSBJ-ADOPTED`, `permission requested`: "The use of any such material on any other website or networked computer environment is strictly prohibited unless prior written permission is granted." The host in the brief, `www.ssbj-j.jp`, does not resolve from the cloud address (`curl: (56) CONNECT tunnel failed, response 502`, also for `ssbj-j.jp` over http and https); the site is `www.ssb-j.jp`, which answered 200. Blocked from the cloud address: `https://www.ssbj-j.jp/`, for the orchestrator to read from the laptop. |
| `jp-tse-cg-code` | Row `JP-JPX-ADOPTED`, `permission requested`: JPX bars secondary use for commercial purposes without prior permission and modification without prior permission. |

The F7 Act on Rationalizing Energy Use and Shifting to Non-fossil Energy (e-Gov law ID `354AC0000000049`) has a `register.csv` row only. Japanese Law Translation pages are named in the `notes` of the scope entries that have one; no translation is stored. Not reached: the Cabinet Order enforcing the Global Warming Act (`411CO0000000143`), the aggregation order (`418M60001400004`), the form PDFs attached to the Cabinet Office Order on Disclosure of Corporate Affairs, and the Official Gazette (Kanpo) for as-promulgated texts and commencement orders.

## South Africa

Fetched and read 2026-11-02 (GEL-03-08). One `pass` row, `ZA-GOVZA-ADOPTED` (basis: Copyright Act 98 of 1978 s.12(8)(a), no copyright in official texts of a legislative, administrative or legal nature; the gov.za terms page alone would not pass, it allows non-commercial use only). Rows `ZA-RESBANK-ADOPTED` and `ZA-JSE-ADOPTED` are `permission requested`. No row for GPW (gpwonline.co.za): its Terms of Use page opened but carried no terms text, and nothing was fetched from it; every gazette PDF used is served by gov.za. FSCA was not needed (no FSCA instrument in scope).

Row `ZA-GOVZA-ADOPTED`, Climate Change Act 22 of 2024 (English and Tshivenda interleaved in one gazette PDF):

```
curl -sS -L -m 60 -A 'Mozilla/5.0' -o cca.pdf -w '%{http_code} %{size_download} %{content_type}\n' https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/202407/50966climatechangeact222024.pdf
```

Returned `200 575512 application/pdf`, sha256 `731eba0336de20b8c983c6e2dc994d5b7697ea407b2258eefe6b749e996695d5`. gov.za resets connections from the cloud address at random (`curl: (35) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer`); every fetch here succeeded within 1 to 6 retries at 5 to 6 s apart. The PDF link on each instrument's page under `https://www.gov.za/documents/...` has the same shape (`/sites/default/files/gcis_document/<YYYYMM>/<file>.pdf`).

Text extraction. The repository has no stdlib PDF reader, so the text was made with poppler `pdftotext` (not stdlib; `tools/update.py` cannot refresh these records): `pdftotext -layout file.pdf -`, then each line stripped and runs of spaces or tabs collapsed to one space, form feeds turned into line breaks, three or more line breaks reduced to two. For the two bilingual gazettes (Climate Change Act, Carbon Tax Act) only page 1 and the even pages were extracted (`pdftotext -layout -f P -l P`): odd pages from 3 on are the Tshivenda or Afrikaans text. Page headers and footers stay in the text. No OCR was run; the text is the PDF's own text layer.

Stored (every record is `adopted`; gov.za serves only the text as published, and later amendments are separate notices, so there is no consolidation to store):

| Instrument | File fetched (under `https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/`) | `in_force` | Bytes |

Not stored, with the reason:

| Instrument | Why |
|---|---|
| `za-companies-regs-2011` | Link only. The PDF (`201409/34239rg9526gon351.pdf`, 20040167 bytes, 303 pages) downloaded and its text layer is good, but no official page opened states the regulations' commencement date, so no dated record can be made. |
| `za-bbbee-act-53-2003` | Link only. `201409/a53-030.pdf` (346271 bytes, 6 pages) is an old OCR layer with words run together; storing it would put corrupt text under a law record. |
| `za-pa-g3-2025-banks`, `za-pa-gn3-2025-insurers` | Link only. Row `ZA-RESBANK-ADOPTED` is `permission requested`: resbank.co.za HTML pages answer a 243-byte rejection to the cloud address, so the terms were not read. The two PDFs opened with a plain `curl` (`200 435853 application/pdf` and `200 441500 application/pdf`) and were read for the issue date only. |
| `za-jse-listings-8-63` | Link only. Blocked from the cloud address: `https://www.jse.co.za/terms-and-conditions`, `/legal`, `/disclaimer`, `/` and the listings PDFs return `403` (a 5 KB rejection page). Row `ZA-JSE-ADOPTED` is `permission requested`. Read from a laptop. |

The JSE Sustainability and Climate Disclosure Guidance (June 2022) is voluntary guidance with a `register.csv` row and no scope entry. The Internet Archive (`web.archive.org`) reset every connection from the cloud address, so no archived terms pages were read. Terms page read: `https://www.gov.za/terms-and-conditions-use-0` (200, 45674 bytes).
